#### A performant bare-bones css-in-js library to build self contained React components with some [drip](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Drip) ðŸ’¦

## Introduction

DripCSS was created to provide a light-weight styling solution to UI component libraries without forcing
end users to adopt the styling solution of the library. Hence, components built using DripCSS can be included
in projects that use other styling solutions (styled-components, css-modules, etc) and even other DripCSS instances,
without feat of conflicts.

**DripCSS was designed to mimic vanilla CSS. It is a vanilla CSS with React integration and some extra utilities.**

## Installation

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm i @resembli/dripcss
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @resembli/dripcss
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm i @resembli/dripcss
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

`@resembli/dripcss` requires [React 18](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) to be installed.

## Usage

DripCSS has a single named export - the `css` function. This function accepts a template and returns a hook
that can be used to style a component.

import { DripDemo } from "./_components/DripDemo.tsx"

<DripDemo />

```jsx
import { css } from "@resembli/dripcss"

const useDrip = css`
  & {
    font-weight: bolder;
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
`

export function DripDemo() {
  const clx = useDrip()

  return <div className={clx}>Give your components some drip</div>
}
```

:::note
DripCSS is essentially 'vanilla' CSS in JavaScript with some extras for creating unique class names, and linking
css variables to dynamically calculated values.

This means everything within the template string should by treated as though you are writing styles in a normal CSS file.

For example, comments must use `/* */` syntax and not `//`, since the later is not a valid CSS comment.
:::

### Dynamic Values

This is a three step process:

- Call the `css` function with your style template. Use interpolated values within the template that are functions to mark
dynamic values for which css variables should be created.
- Call the hook returned from `css` in your component.
  - The hook returns a `string` (which is a unique className) if no arguments are passed to it
  - Otherwise it returns a tuple of type `[string, CSSProperties]`
- Set the `className` of the component you want to style. If dynamic values are being used, you need to set the `style` value to the
object returned from the hook. It contains the values of the variables which will be applied to your component.

```tsx
import { css } from "@resembli/dripcss"

const useVariableMargin = css<{ margin: number}>`
  /* & will become a class name like css-13dadaty3 */
  & {
    margin: ${p => `${p.margin}px`} /* the function must return a string */
  }
`

function MyVariableMarginComponent() {
  const [clx, sx] = useVariableMargin({ margin: 20 });

  return <div className={clx} style={sx}>I will have some margin</div>
}
```

## Global styles

```tsx

const useGlobal = css`
  html, body {
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
  }
  #root {
    height: 100%;
  }
`

function App() {
  useGlobal(); // Will return a string, but this can safely be ignored.

  return <div>Some content</div>
}
```

:::caution

As in vanilla CSS, style rules are not scoped. Hence the following call:

```tsx
const useStyle = css`
  h1 {
    font-weight: 2rem;
  }
`
```
Will create a hook the styles all `h1` elements on the page.
