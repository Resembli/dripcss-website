## Introduction

A performant bare-bones css-in-js library to build self contained React components.

DripCSS was created to provide a light-weight styling solution to UI component libraries without forcing
end users to adopt the styling solution of the library. Hence, components built using DripCSS can be included
in projects that use other styling solutions (styled-components, css-modules, etc) and even other DripCSS instances,
without feat of conflicts.

## Installation

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm i @resembli/dripcss
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @resembli/dripcss
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm i @resembli/dripcss
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

DripCSS has a single named export - the `css` function. This function accepts a template and returns a hook
that can be used to style a component.

import { DripDemo } from "./_components/DripDemo.tsx"

<DripDemo />

```jsx
import { css } from "@resembli/dripcss"

const useDrip = css`
  & {
    font-weight: bolder;
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
`

export function DripDemo() {
  const clx = useDrip()

  return <div className={clx}>Give your components some drip</div>
}
```

## How is DripCSS different?

DripCSS is closer to vanilla CSS than it is to the css-in-js solutions you'd find elsewhere.

- Only template string syntax is supportted. Object css objects are not supported.
- DripCSS has a near zero runtime.
- Styles are **NOT** scoped by default. Instead the template string must use `&` to scope a style.
  - `&` symbols in the template string will be replaced by a unique class by DripCSS.
- Dynamic styling is only supported through CSS variables. DripCSS does not perform string interpolation, or create new classes as props change.
  - DripCSS provides a syntax for linking CSS variables to React props.
  - This makes DripCSS significantly faster than alternative css-in-js solutions.
- Nested css is not supported (remember DripCSS vanilla CSS with some exta support for working with React)
